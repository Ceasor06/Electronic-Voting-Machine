# Electronic-Voting-Machine
## Microcontroller based EVM, using 8051 microcontroller (AT89C51)

The Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) is a simple electronic device used to record votes in place of ballot papers and boxes which were used before in conventional voting system. 
Electronic voting machine has now replaced the traditional voting system due to several advantages like security, automatic counting etc.
In this project we describe a microcontroller based Electronic Voting Machine. 


This system is constructed using 8051 microcontrollers (AT89C51), The circuit is constructed using proteus software and its software program is written with C language using Keil software. 
This is an effective tool for voting, this system accepts votes and keep counting the total votes polled and LCD is used to display vote conformation and election results, by pressing the result switch the subsequent count can be seen on LCD.
