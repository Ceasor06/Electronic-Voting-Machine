## Microcontroller based EVM, using 8051 microcontroller (AT89C51)

The Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) is a simple electronic device used to record votes in place of ballot papers and boxes which were used before in conventional voting system. 
Electronic voting machine has now replaced the traditional voting system due to several advantages like security, automatic counting etc.
In this project we describe a microcontroller based Electronic Voting Machine. 


This system is constructed using **_8051 microcontrollers (AT89C51)_**, The circuit is constructed using proteus software and its software program is written with C language using Keil software. 
This is an effective tool for voting, this system accepts votes and keep counting the total votes polled and LCD is used to display vote conformation and election results, by pressing the result switch the subsequent count can be seen on LCD.

**The AT89C51 microcontroller used in this project is a low-power high-performance cmos 8- bit microcomputer with 4k bytes of flash programmable and erasable read only memory (perom). The device is manufactured using atmelâ€™s high-density non-volatile memory technology and is compatible with the industry standardmcs-51 instruction set and pinout.**

### The components used in this projects are:

- 8051 Microcontroller
* LCD
+ LED
- Control Switches

In this project, Proteus was used to build our Electronic voting machine, specifically: _Proteus 8.0_ was used which is a Virtual System Modelling (VSM) that combines circuit simulation, animated components and microprocessor models to co-simulate the complete microcontroller based designs. This is the perfect tool for engineers to test their microcontroller designs before constructing a physical prototype in real time. This program allows users to interact with the design using on-screen indicators and/or LED and LCD displays and, if attached to the PC, switches and buttons.

**Flash Magic is a software used to upload or burn the verified code from keil uVision into the microcontroller.**

***Software Used:***

- Flash Magic
* Keil uVision
+ Proteus
